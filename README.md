# Python HDF reader for ACE data

This is what I was looking for. Didn't find it, so I made it :)
Python makes life so easy.

You can find [here](./cython/src) a Cython implementation that communicates Python with the C-API of HDF4 format.
First compile the cython files, and [here](./cython/scripts) are some tests.

---
NOTES:
- The C sources that talk directly to the C-API were generated by [this](http://www.srl.caltech.edu/ACE/ASC/exhdfgen/index.htm) Perl script.
I just made the Cython interface. 

- ACE data files have HDF version 4.1r2 [link](http://www.srl.caltech.edu/ACE/ASC/hdf.html), and `pyhdf` and `python-hdf` libraries don't seem to be friendly with it :\
