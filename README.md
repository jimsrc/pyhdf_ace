# Python HDF reader for ACE data

This is what I was looking for. Didn't find it, so I made it :)
Python makes life so easy.

You can find [here](./cython/src) a Cython implementation that communicates Python with the C-API of HDF4 format.
First compile the cython files, and [here](./cython/scripts) are some tests.

---
NOTES:
- The C sources that talk directly to the C-API were generated by [this](http://www.srl.caltech.edu/ACE/ASC/exhdfgen/index.htm) Perl script.
I just made the Cython interface. 

- ACE data files have HDF version 4.1r2 [link](http://www.srl.caltech.edu/ACE/ASC/hdf.html), and `pyhdf` and `python-hdf` libraries don't seem to be friendly with it :\

- It's been test with [HDF4 v4.2.12](ftp://ftp.hdfgroup.org/HDF/HDF_Current/src/hdf-4.2.12.tar.bz2). 
  In some platforms, it may be necessary to build hdf4 with `fPIC`; i.e.:

```bash
$ CFLAGS=-fPIC ./configure --with-zlib=$HOME/local --with-jpeg=$HOME/local --with-szlib=$HOME/local --prefix=$HOME/local
```

  For more details, see [here](ftp://ftp.hdfgroup.org/HDF/releases/HDF4.2.12/src/unpacked/release_notes/INSTALL) and [here](http://lists.osgeo.org/pipermail/gdal-dev/2016-April/044125.html).
