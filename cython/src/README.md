To compile:

```bash
make clean
make
```

We should have the message ` --> all ok.` at the end, and now the file
`cython_wrapper.so` exists. 
So now, you can test it [here](../scripts).

NOTE:
The C sources were generated by [this]() perl code, which uses `.h` C structures as in [here](ftp://mussel.srl.caltech.edu/pub/ace/level2/acel2src.zip).
The former `.h` files correspond to ACE [L2 data](http://www.srl.caltech.edu/ACE/ASC/level2/) stored in HDF files.
